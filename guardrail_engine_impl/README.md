# Guardrail Engine — Reference Implementation

This package is a **reference Python implementation** of:

Personal AI Guardrail Engine — Specification v1.0.0

## Purpose
- Demonstrate a correct, minimal implementation of the guardrail spec
- Serve as a dependency for downstream projects
- Act as an executable contract test for the specification

## Non-Goals
- No execution of tasks
- No learning or adaptation
- No policy inference
- No optimization
- No UI integration

## Authority
The specification in `guardrail_engine_spec/` is the sole source of truth.
If a discrepancy exists, the specification wins.

## Status
Reference-only implementation.
